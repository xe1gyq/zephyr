# Terminology

> **Real Time Operating System**
>
> > A real-time operating system \(RTOS\) is an operating system \(OS\) intended to serve real-time application process data as it comes in, typically without buffering delays. Processing time requirements \(including any OS delay\) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system)

> **Single Address Space Operating System**
>
> > In computer science, a single address space operating system \(or SASOS\) is an operating system that provides for all processes only one globally shared virtual address space. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_address_space_operating_system)
>
> **Monolithic Kernel**
>
> > An operating system architecture where the entire operating system is working in kernel space and is alone in supervisor mode. The monolithic model differs from other operating system architectures \(such as the microkernel architecture\) in that it alone defines a high-level virtual interface over computer hardware. A set of primitives or system calls implement all operating system services such as process management, concurrency, and memory management. Device drivers can be added to the kernel as modules. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel)
>
> **Microkernel**
>
> > In computer science, a microkernel \(also known as Î¼-kernel\) is the near-minimum amount of software that can provide the mechanisms needed to implement an operating system \(OS\). These mechanisms include low-level address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication \(IPC\). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel)
>
> **Nanokernel**
>
> > A kernel where the total amount of kernel code, i.e. code executing in the privileged mode of the hardware, is very small. The term picokernel was sometimes used to further emphasize small size. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel#Nanokernel)

> **Semaphore**
>
> > In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access, by multiple processes, to a common resource in a concurrent system such as a multiprogramming operating system. \[Wikipedia\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore\_\(programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming)\)
>
> **Multithreading**
>
> > Multithreading is mainly found in multitasking operating systems. Multithreading is a widespread programming and execution model that allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently. The threaded programming model provides developers with a useful abstraction of concurrent execution. \[Wikipedia\]\([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread\_\(computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_%28computing)\)\)
>
> **Interrup Handler**
>
> > In computer systems programming, an interrupt handler, also known as an interrupt service routine or ISR, is a callback function in microcontroller firmware, an operating system or a device driver, whose execution is triggered by the reception of an interrupt. In general, interrupts and their handlers are used to handle high-priority conditions that require the interruption of the current code the processor is executing. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler)
>
> **Mutex**
>
> > In computer science, mutual exclusion refers to the requirement of ensuring that no two concurrent processes\[a\] are in their critical section at the same time; it is a basic requirement in concurrency control, to prevent race conditions. Here, a critical section refers to a period when the process accesses a shared resource, such as shared memory. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion)
>
> **Memory Allocation**
>
> > Memory management is the act of managing computer memory at the system level. The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed. This is critical to any advanced computer system where more than a single process might be underway at any time. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management)
>
> **Power Management**
>
> > Power Management is a feature of electrical appliances that turns off the power or switches the system to a low-power state when inactive. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_management)
>
> **SCADA**
>
> > Supervisory control and data acquisition \(SCADA\) is a system for remote monitoring and control that operates with coded signals over communication channels \(using typically one communication channel per remote station\). The control system may be combined with a data acquisition system by adding the use of coded signals over communication channels to acquire information about the status of the remote equipment for display or for recording functions.
